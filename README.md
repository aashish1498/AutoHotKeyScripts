# AutoHotKeyScripts

A script which allows for some small automation using the 'F1' key on your keyboard.

The shortcuts are mostly for my own productivity enhancements, but can be modified fairly easily.

The shortcuts work by pressing the keys **after** pressing F1 (and any subsequant key), not simultaneous.

| Key combination |Outcome |
|---|---|
|**F1** + **T**| Pins current window to the top of the screen  |
|**F1** + **C**| Activates clipboard array copy - choose a number 1 to 5 to copy text to that location  |
|**F1** + **P**| Activates clipboard array paste - choose the number 1 to 5 to paste text from that location   |
|**F1** + **W**| Activates input for Word automation. Another input is required <br /> **S**: Insert subscript (in equation mode) <br /> **I**: Insert a cross reference   |
